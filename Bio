Hi, I’m **lcmonz**! I’m interested in learning how to code a Friday Night Funkin' mod from the original source code.
I’m currently learning how to use Haxe and Lua, but I'm still a beginner. I’m looking to collaborate on anything FNF-related, so I can learn the ropes.
You can reach me via GitHub and Twitter.
